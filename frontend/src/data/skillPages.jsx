    story: [
      "The best leaders aren’t always the loudest. Maya, a quiet second-year student, never saw herself as a leader. But when her club faced disbandment, she stepped in—not to command, but to listen. She made people feel heard, gave them roles they thrived in, and brought the group back together.",

    story: [

    story: [
      "Rahul was known for being quick-witted, but his relationships often suffered. During a mentorship program, he was forced to just listen—no advice, no fixing. That changed everything. His mentee opened up. He learned that sometimes the greatest help is just presence.",
